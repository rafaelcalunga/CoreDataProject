#  Core Data Examples

This project contains some examples using Core Data 

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially Core Data with SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Create NSManagedObject subclasses
- Conditional save of NSManagedObjectContext
- Ensure Core Data objects are unique using constraints
- Filter @FetchRequest using NSPredicate
- Dynamically filter @FetchRequest with SwiftUI
- One-to-many relationships with Core Data, SwiftUI, and @FetchRequest
- Create a generic list view to be used with any CoreData entity

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
